## Hi, I'm Mariana

I am a software developer with 4 years of professional experience collaborating in multidisciplinary teams and developing independent projects. This experience allows me to consider multiple factors to propose objective solutions. In my most recent experience, I have had the opportunity to lead an engineering team, providing guidance and mentoring to its members for their professional growth.

I feel gratified to be able to contribute to the growth of the people in the team, promoting a collaborative and stimulating environment. I believe in the importance of open communication and constant feedback to foster a productive work environment.

I am committed to excellence and quality in my work, always seeking to overcome challenges and achieve outstanding results.
